# React TypeScript Redux Starter

React TypeScript Redux Starter is a simple opinionated project to reduce the burden of having to re-implement the same thing over and over again.

This starter kit does not aim to be an all-in-one solution, nor the ultimate starter application for all web app projects.
This project merely aims to be a starting point for developers to kick-start the most commonly used libraries in the React ecosystem.

## Development Stack

This project uses the following packages:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for build scripts
- TypeScript as it's development language
- [Material UI Theme](https://material-ui.com/) for component styling
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for Redux
- [Connected React Router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router/) for routing
- ESLint/Prettier for linting
- Jest for unit testing
